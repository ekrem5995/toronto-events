Too Much Fashion - An Ode to Black Creative Resilience

United Contemporary is proud to present “Too Much Fashion”, a powerful group exhibition that celebrates Black cultural influence, creative resilience, and the enduring intersections between fashion and art across the Black diaspora. Together, nine black artists create a textured narrative that recognizes fashion not only as clothing or ornamentation, but as a profound mode of storytelling, cultural assertion, and survival.

- Gordon Shadrach reframes historical portraiture to challenge dominant narratives of Black masculinity.

- Benny Bing paints commanding portraits that centre the dignity and complexity of Black identity through vivid colour and form.

- Veronica Dorsett is a visual artist whose practice encompasses a wide range of materials that focuses a critical lens on Black hair politics and adolescence.

- Ojo Agi renders delicate, emotive figures on brown paper, celebrating the nuances of Black skin and care rituals.

- Ehiko Odeh transforms everyday Black hair products into monumental paintings that reassert presence and pride.

- Kachelle Knowles explores the ideas of gender identity, cultural preservation, production, and social relations within the black community.

- Janice Reid captures expansive photographic portraits across the Caribbean and North America, offering liberatory representations of Black trans, cis, and non-binary individuals.

- Kriss Munsya focuses on the role of race and gender in the construction of identity and memory through an expanded photographic practice.

- Adetona Omokanye is a photojournalist and visual artist whose work captures the richness and complexity of African cultures through a distinct visual lens.

Co-curated by Byron Armstrong and Ilene Sova of Armova Curatorial, this timely exhibition opens to the public on Friday, August 1, 2025, with a celebratory reception, aligning with Emancipation Month and the Toronto Carnival—two significant events that honour Black freedom, identity, and joy.

Free First Friday Night Performance: Stephanie Chua and Allison Cameron

Presented within Margaux Williamson's “Shoes, Books, Hands, Buildings, and Cars” at MOCA, this live performance investigates surface, perception, and the present moment in dialogue with the exhibition.

The evening opens as pianist Stephanie Chua performs Morton Feldman’s “For Bunita Marcus,” a 75-minute solo work renowned for its quiet intensity and spacious beauty. As the final notes dissipate, composer and sound artist Allison Cameron joins Chua in an improvised soundscape that responds intimately to Williamson’s paintings.

Together, Chua and Cameron mirror Williamson’s layered visual compositions, where everyday objects and multiple perspectives coexist. Drawing from Feldman’s resonant, durational style, their performance extends this sensibility into the physical realm, sounding the inside of the piano to create a tactile, immersive sonic experience.

This performance is part of MOCA’s Free First Friday Nights. Admission is Free from 5–9 pm. Tickets can be obtained ahead of time or at the door. Book in advance to reserve your spot!

Theatre In St James Presents: The Tragedie of Romeo & Juliet

Pay what you can. No ticket required. Join us in St James Park, 120 King Street E, on and around the Michael Comstock Pavilion for Theatre In St. James Park.

Written by William Shakespeare

Directed by Nicholas Koy Santillo

Four Actors.

Two Households.

One Absolute Banger.

What was Shakespeare before stage lights, microphones and the Fourth Wall? Before he was revered and canonized, Shakespeare's plays were raucous, irreverent and relevant. When first staged in 1596, Romeo and Juliet referenced contemporary politics and the eternal human condition.

Much has changed since the 16th century, yet The Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet remains poignant and powerful — an autocratic Prince, an optimistic proselytizer, a loving nurse, and two star-crossed lovers.

This summer, whether you're in Verona or Toronto, one thing is certain: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.

Paint and SIP: A Midsummer's Night Dream

Join us for paint night at Toronto’s newest paint studio – My Inner Child Paint Bar. Our paint and sip classes encourage you to explore your Inner Artist whether you’re an experienced painter or haven’t picked up a paint brush since elementary school. We promise a fun-filled evening of artistic expression, drink, and music in a relaxed atmosphere. Owner/artist, Claire, at My Inner Child believes that everyone can paint as we all used to do when we were little, we just need to tap into our INNER CHILD. Art is fun. Art is expressive. Art is creative. Art is healing.

Our paint nites are ideal for date night, girl’s night out and anyone looking to try something different.

The class is expected to take about 2.5 hours to complete, however, we guarantee extra studio time to allow you to put the final touches on your masterpiece.

We are conveniently located in mid-town Toronto, at 2725 Yonge Street north of Eglinton. There is plenty of cheap parking underground in the building as well as ample street parking.

Pub Crawl Toronto

THE BEST PUB CRAWL IN TORONTO

Awarded the Badge of Excellence from TripAdvisor as the best pub crawl in the city 🏅

Featured on BlogTO as one of the best ways to meet people in Toronto 🤩

and…

Drink deals! 🎉🎉🎉

Party with fun people! 😍😍😍

We're headed to 3 really fun amazing spots on College Street, one of the funnest, coolest neighbourhoods in Toronto! See you there!

MEETING POINT

Track & Field, 582 College St.

When you get to the bar, ask a bartender where the pub crawl is (i.e. us) and they will direct you.

PARTY AGENDA

➡️ 9pm-10pm- Mingling with the Pub Crawl at our first bar of the night! Plus a free welcome shot, exclusive to Pub Crawl Toronto guests!

➡️ 10pm-11pm- Fun times at the 2nd stop of the night!

➡️ 11pm-Close- Party the rest of the night away at our 3rd and final stop of the night, a nightclub to dance the night away to awesome music! You get FREE ENTRY to the club too! Nice!

HOW WE’RE DIFFERENT (And the best, in our opinion! 😀😀)

➡️ Our prices will not increase between now and the pub crawl

➡️ Real drink specials exclusive to Pub Crawl Toronto- these are deals you won't get without a ticket to the crawl!

➡️ We don’t ditch pub crawlers at the door of the first stop of the night. Our host will be guiding the crawl throughout, to help ensure everyone has an amazing time!

➡️ Everyone moves together on the crawl, making it a great and easy way to meet everyone!

LOGISTICAL DETAILS

➡️ Can't find us? DM 647-746-3723 for help!

➡️ Every bar/club we are going to is less than 5 mins walking from the next one. So don’t worry about needing to walk any sort of long distance.

➡️ Make sure to come early so you can socialize with the group before things get crazy!

KLEAN: CARIBANA NIGHT PARTY

On Aug 1, it's Caribana 2025: KLEAN – Night Party

Dress fresh. Move wild. KLEAN is where style meets Soca for a night of pure energy and elegant chaos.

With Soca, Dancehall, and Afrobeat setting the pace, this party is built for the bold—high heat, heavy riddims, and a crowd that came to shell in style. From start to finish, it's nothing but clean fits, dirty wines, and nonstop movement.

Welcome to Artbox's Glow in the Dark Paint Night! An Artistic, Sensory Experience like no other.

You'll be guided step-by-step and also encouraged to add your own creative touches to your piece. During the workshop, guests are able to call on the instructor if they need help with anything. The end is flexible for those who need a little extra time to work on their piece.

Materials: You'll be equipped with an apron, 11X14” canvas, paints and all necessary supplies to create a glowing piece of art.

Snacks & Refreshments: Enjoy from a selection of refreshments, tea/coffee and snacks all included with your ticket.

Who Should Join: Connect with fellow creatives in a unique and inspiring setting. Not sure if you’re creative? If you come to this paint night, consider yourself creative. Perfect for beginners and seasoned artists alike, this event offers an artistic, immersive experience for all. Let your inner artist out in a serene and supportive environment at Artbox Studio Gallery.

Architecture Camp

Toronto Metropolitan University Department of Architectural Science presents this week-long camp for campers looking to unleash their creativity! Campers learn from some of the top Architectural Science students at Toronto Metropolitan, and participate in innovative and engaging team and individual exercises.

Each week's program culminates in a distinct take-home project that campers develop and take home on the final day of the week.

Camp days comprise an even balance of Architecture programming and physically active Camp games, so your camper goes home each day having nurtured both their body and brain.

The curriculum for Architecture Camp is developed by Prof. Vince Hui, who is a past recipient of the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations Teacher Award.

Art/Wear: Sneakers x Artists

“What is art?” This question has sparked debate for centuries, and today, the boundaries of what defines art are being pushed further than ever. One significant shift is the growing trend of artists engaging in commercial collaborations, particularly with sneaker brands. These collaborations blur the lines between art, fashion, and commerce, offering consumers the opportunity to buy and wear creations by some of the most revered figures in the art world. Many of these sneakers are also finding their place within traditional art spaces, such as museums and auction houses, where their rarity has elevated them to a status similar to limited edition artist prints. The cultural significance of these artist-sneaker collaborations is contributing to the ongoing discussion of what defines art today.

Many artists are increasingly using sneakers in conceptually rich ways to challenge and redefine conventional artistic boundaries. By manipulating the familiar form of sneakers, these artists create provocative works that explore themes of consumerism, personal expression, and societal expectations. Through their deconstruction, repurposing, and political use of sneakers, these artists invite viewers to reconsider the intersections between art, fashion, and identity in the modern world.

Art/Wear: Sneakers and Artists asks why artists are drawn to working on/with sneakers and why so many of us are interested in wearing these pieces. It also explores the longstanding divide in Western thought between art and fashion, ultimately questioning if and how our collective definitions of art are shifting. Topics explored include: a history of sneakers as canvases, graffiti artists and sneakers, and artist collabs, and the rise of customization as its own art form.

Artists on view: Aaron Fowler, Alife, Andrew Mania, Bryant Giles, Cey Adams, Damien Hirst, Daniel Arsham, Dave White, ESPO, Futura, Eric Haze, Hebru Brantley, Javier Calleja, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Judi Werthein, Kate Knudsen, KAWS, Keith Haring, Kenzo Minami, Mache, Michael Lau, MSCHF, Peter Max, Ruohan Wang, Shantell Martin, Stash, Takashi Murakami, Tom Sachs, Vicky Vuong, and Virgil Abloh.

A State of Balance: New Exhibition by Sheila Kernan Exploring Nature, Harmony, and the Creative Process at Bau-Xi Gallery Dufferin

Sheila Kernan’s upcoming exhibition, A State of Balance, is a powerful meditation on harmony, tension, and the quiet intelligence of nature. In this new body of work, Kernan invites viewers into richly layered compositions where visual opposites - soft and sharp, dense and airy, stillness and movement - are masterfully brought into alignment. Drawing inspiration from the ever-shifting rhythms of the natural world, particularly the landscapes of Muskoka and the Great Lakes, Kernan creates paintings that feel both grounded and alive. A State of Balance offers a space to pause, reflect, and contemplate the beauty and balance found in both nature and art.

The exhibition will be on view from July 10th - August 4th at Bau-Xi Gallery | Dufferin in Toronto (1384 Dufferin Street). An opening reception will take place on Saturday, July 12th from 2 - 5 pm with Sheila Kernan in attendance.

Artist statement:

“In this new collection, I strive to achieve a unique state of balance within each painting and throughout the series. Through careful manipulation of contrasting painted elements—such as soft and hard edges, thick textures and thin washes, foreground, and background elements, I engage in a constant process of editing and reworking until my intuitive sense of equilibrium has been attained. This pursuit of balance often requires multiple layers of paint, numerous techniques, a careful observant eye, intense concentration, and presence.

There is delicate reciprocity between each visual element. At times it can be harmonious, offering stability. At times it can be more dynamic, offering an interplay between opposing forces and ideas. The movement between both creates a sense of dynamism and tension, which becomes its own form of balance even if not static. All of which contribute to creating an eye-catching composition.

Nature is a prime example of dynamic balance; its constant state of flux is truly inspirational and why I enjoy mirroring it in my compositions. I value how nature provides a sanctuary for us, it fosters a sense of connection and well-being that contributes significantly to joy, happiness, and contentment. Nature has always been an underlying theme in my paintings, and I am particularly drawn to places that I have a personal connection with. My family’s roots in the east stretch back generations, and each time I visit, I feel a profound connection to the land especially Muskoka and the Great Lakes.

By sharing my process with you, I hope to provide some insight and to invite you to contemplate the beauty and balance found in both nature and art.” – Sheila Kernan

About Sheila Kernan:

Sheila Kernan is a Calgary-based artist who is known for her unique and tactile aesthetic. Her work oscillates between realism and abstraction, referencing memory and imagination. Her compositions are meticulously crafted through her use of referential collages made from multiple photographs and sketches. Intensely saturated colours, graphic forms and thick painterly strokes collide in multiple layers.

Sheila Kernan’s work can be found in numerous private, corporate, and public art collections across North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa. Having earned her B.F.A from the Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD) in 2006, she has gone on to showcase her work nationally in more than 40 exhibitions. In 2017, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award as the recipient of the ACAD Alumni Legacy Award.

A Transit Through Time

The exhibition located in the West Wing is a co-curatorial project in collaboration with MakeRoom Inc. Union’s relationship with MakeRoom Inc was born out of a shared mission to create spaces for local artists that are inclusive, diverse and equitable. This year the call asked artists to respond to the following questions: What does culture mean to you? How do you honour the past?

The featured works of artists Destinie Adélakun, Pixel Heller, Segun Caezar, Heritier Bilaka, Rico Poku and Camille Kiffin encourage exploration of the connections between the past and present, and the traditions that have shaped culture through time. They offer a glimpse into the enduring legacy and boundless creativity of Black communities.

In addition to the group exhibition, Union has selected special guest artist Jordan Sook to present the solo exhibition, Nothing More Nothing Less, a collection of images of butterflies showcased in various mediums throughout Union for people to discover. The butterflies, containing the artist's signature hand painted spots, represent self-expression and the joyfulness of the human spirit. Each piece merges entomology with curiosity, exploring themes of metamorphosis, transformation and evolution.

Opening to the public on Wednesday, February 12, at 6pm with an artist panel and musical celebration. The exhibitions are open daily during station operating hours and are located on the ground level in the West Wing and Oak Room. Additionally, Jordan Sook’s works extend to the station’s exterior banners along Front Street, as well as digital screens and a hoarding wall in the new lower area of the station. Admission is free, and the exhibition runs until August 2025.

Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away.

The internationally touring exhibition, created by Musealia, co-produced by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland, and developed with an esteemed international panel of curators and historians, is one of the most comprehensive exhibitions ever presented on the subject, and ROM is the only Canadian stop on its international tour. Survivor testimonials, historical documentation, and first-hand accounts by emancipating forces create a powerful connection to the exhibition's more than 500 original objects — many of which have never been seen before in Canada — on loan from the Auschwitz Memorial and more than 20 other major institutions and private collections around the world.

Canadian Photographs: 1900 - 1950

Recent events have prompted citizens of Canada to reflect on our country’s significance. When we recall the places, events, and people that have shaped our collective memory, it is often photographs that come to mind. To support this reflection and inspire further appreciation, we have selected works from the gallery’s collection that highlight the important role photography plays in documenting history. This exhibition also offers an opportunity to recognize the contributions of Canadian photographers to the development of the medium.

This exhibition features photographs taken in Canada, as well as works created by Canadians elsewhere. Organized into thematic sections, the exhibition begins with images of Toronto as an emerging metropolis, followed by views of other regions across a span of fifty years. One section is dedicated to Canadian photographers working in the Pictorialist style, a movement that played a role in shifting photographic practices and paved the way toward Modernism. The final selection focusses on portraits of Canadians as well as photographs of events—both major and minor—that illustrate the era.

Canadian Stage presents the 42nd annual Dream in High Park - ROMEO & JULIET

Now celebrating 42 years of bringing Torontonians together for the beloved summer theatre tradition of Shakespeare under the stars, Canadian Stage is thrilled to present this year’s magical Dream in High Park production – the Bard’s most touching and romantic tragedy – ROMEO & JULIET, on stage in the enchanting High Park Amphitheatre from July 13th to August 31st.

One of Shakespeare’s most adored and enduring plays, ROMEO & JULIET is the greatest of love stories and romantic tragedies. Following the titular ill-fated lovers whose rival families, the Capulets and Montagues, are locked in a brutal blood feud, this most iconic work has captivated audiences and artists for centuries and been reimagined within countless films, ballets, operas, novels and more.

Pack a picnic, some pillows, and a cozy blanket, and head to High Park for Toronto's dreamiest date night.

Chinese Zodiac Case: Year of the Snake at ROM

As part of our annual zodiac installation, January 29, 2025 ushers in the Year of the Snake (蛇), the sixth animal in the Chinese zodiac. Those born under this sign are believed to be wise and charismatic.

The snake rarely appears as a decorative motif in Chinese art and design, however, when depicted with a tortoise, the pair have come to symbolize the mythical creature Xuanwu (玄武, the Dark Warrior), later evolving into the god Zhenwu (真武, the Perfected Warrior). The snake and tortoise symbolize the interplay of power, wisdom, and harmony of nature.

Experience an exquisite array of snake and tortoise-themed objects and cultural belongings in this specially curated zodiac case. Marvel at impressive ceramics, including a mythical double-headed serpent from the early 500s. This and much more are now on view in this unique display celebrating the powerful snake.

Each evening kicks off at 8:45 p.m. with a pre-show featuring live performances, photo ops, film introductions and other outdoor activities. Movie goers can purchase concessions including TIFF’s “famous popcorn”, cold beverages, sweets and cotton candy. Bring your blankets, lawn chairs, and your cinephile crew, and settle in for some big screen magic in the heart of downtown Toronto.

Here are the details:

Emo Night North

As Canada’s longest-running emo night, this event sells out every single week, pulling in a crowd of nostalgic scene kids and new-wave punks. Expect wall-to-wall bangers from the golden era of emo, pop-punk, and post-hardcore: MCR, Paramore, Blink, and all your heartbreak heroes.

Held every Friday at Sneaky Dee’s, the vibe is loud, sweaty, and cathartic — a full-throttle singalong for everyone who still holds a torch for Warped Tour and band tees.

Get there early. Wear black. Scream your heart out.

🖤 Because some nights, emo is everything.

Exhibit A: Investigating Crime & Footwear

This exhibition examines both the development of footwear forensics as a means of solving crime and the social constructions of criminality from the nineteenth century to today. It also considers how clothing and footwear play roles in cultural ideas of criminality informed by assumptions and bias. This exhibition will take visitors on a journey to sleuth out the central but complex role of footwear in crime, policing, the judiciary system and our cultural ideas of criminality.

Curated by:

Dr. Alison Matthews David, Professor at the School of Fashion, Toronto Metropolitan University

Elizabeth Semmelhack, Director and Senior Curator, Bata Shoe Museum

George Byrne Debuts Synthetica - A Surreal Reimagining of the American Landscape at Bau-Xi Gallery Dufferin

Acclaimed photographic artist George Byrne returns with Synthetica, a bold new exhibition that fuses analogue photography with digital innovation to reimagine the American landscape. Rooted in Byrne’s early influences from the New Topographics movement, this series marks a striking evolution in his practice. Where once he documented, he now deconstructs and rebuilds - layering, subtracting, and collaging until a new reality emerges. The result is a collection of surreal yet grounded dreamscapes, where the ordinary is elevated and the boundaries between the natural and the artificial dissolve. From Daytona Beach to Yellowstone, Synthetica is both a visual journey and a conceptual inquiry - exploring the way we perceive, manipulate, and emotionally respond to our environments in a hyper-mediated, AI-inflected age.

The exhibition will be on view from July 10 - August 4 at Bau-Xi Gallery | Dufferin in Toronto (1384 Dufferin Street). An opening reception will take place on Saturday, July 12 from 2 - 5 pm with George Byrne in attendance.

Artist statement:

“This series explores the tension between the natural and the artificial, challenging preconceptions of reality in an increasingly digital age, while also paying homage to my analogue photographic roots. Starting out as an artist, I was very much a student of the New Topographics photographic movement, a style based on the artist's neutral eye, famous for documenting the mundane structures of post-war America. About 5 years ago, I started to become interested in employing various forms of manipulation and digital reconstruction into the work I was making. As a result, the images were able to become more expressive and introspective; a bridge between my subconscious and conscious. Each image in the Synthetica series started as a medium format film photograph, then, through a process of addition, subtraction, collage and endless reevaluation, a new completed image is born. The foundation of a lot of the images in this series were taken over the last few years during road trips I took around the United States. From Daytona Beach to Yellowstone National Park, these were both natural and man-made landscapes - places I'd never been.” – George Byrne

About George Byrne:

George Byrne is an internationally recognized photographer based in Los Angeles. Byrne creates large-scale photographs that depict architectural surfaces and landscapes as painterly abstractions. Borrowing from the clean, vivid clarity of modernist painting, he also references the New Topographics photography movement via a subject matter firmly entrenched in the urban everyday.

Byrne started photographing Los Angeles with a medium format camera in 2010. Byrne’s close-crop photos, often taken from the middle of the street, show careful attention to the geometric fragments of his urban surroundings revealed in subtle line and unexpected shadow which cut across pastel walled surfaces, and divide soft sky from gritty stucco, plastic and concrete. Byrne’s work encapsulates not only the spirit of his adopted city’s unique and diverse cityscape but an aesthetic sensibility that has come to be ubiquitous with our globalized visual culture influenced by equal parts art history and Instagram.

George Byrne was born in Sydney, Australia in 1976 and graduated from Sydney College of the Arts in 2001. He has exhibited internationally in Italy, India, Australia, Los Angeles, and New York. In 2019, Byrne placed third in the Fine Art category of the Minimalist Photography Awards and was named the Minimalist Photographer of the Year in the Minimalist Photography Awards' 2020 edition. Byrne relocated to Los Angeles, California in 2010, where he continues to live and work.

Ghosts of the Sea

One of the most talked about Canadian films at Hot Docs 2025 returns for its Toronto theatrical premiere.

Until the age of two, Virginia Tangvald lived an unconventional life, sailing the world with her mother, her brother Thomas, and their renowned sailor father, the Norwegian adventurer Peter Tangvald. Years after her father’s death, now a mother herself, Tangvald pieces together the fragments of her family’s story and uncovers a chilling series of events, through which she confronts her now-infamous father’s complex legacy. Haunted by his story and the mysterious death of her beloved brother Thomas, she revisits family friends and an extensive family archive to connect the dots. As the film’s prologue states, Aristotle once said: “There are three kinds of people: the living, the dead and those who go to sea.” Tangvald embraces this sentiment and stylistically infuses her film with an air of the in-between, as her dreamy, melancholic voice leads us through this dark family tale. - Aisha Jamal, Hot Docs

In English and French, with English subtitles.

Ghosts of the Sea - Screenings

The National Film Board of Canada is proud to present the Toronto Theatrical Release of GHOSTS OF THE SEA. A film by Virginia Tangvald.

While searching for clues about the death of her brother, who was lost at sea, Virginia Tangvald embarks on a fascinating investigation into her family’s dark secrets. Calling into question the idyllic life of her father, legendary sailor Peter Tangvald, her quest dismantles the myth of absolute freedom and offers the hope that a toxic cycle has been broken.

Home Game: Toronto Loves Basketball

Home Game: Toronto Loves Basketball chronicles the love story between a city and a sport. Even before the Toronto Raptors and the rallying cry “We the North”, basketball in Toronto was deeply rooted in the evolving social and cultural conditions of our city and its people.

From the Canadian invention of basketball to the early women’s game in 1895, to the first professional game played by the Toronto Huskies in 1946, and the recent creation of the Toronto Tempo WNBA team, these milestones chart the development of the sport in our city.

This exhibition, along with a series of profiles on fellow Torontonians, explores how the relationship between basketball and Toronto is unlike any other in the world.

Home Game App: Museum of Toronto has partnered with Dr. Sarah Bay-Cheng, Prof. Angela Norwood and her students in the Design Lab at York University to develop an app that will bring basketball history to life via augmented reality.

Through the app you can custom design your own basketball jersey and view contemporary and historical game-related objects, including the first Toronto Huskies game ticket and Scarborough Shooting Stars trophy.

In addition to an app entry portal at Harbourfront Centre, three off-site activations will be connected via the Home Game app and will allow fans to learn more about Toronto’s basketball history and share their basketball memories through the app’s AR experience, including:

Pan Am Centre

York University, Vari Hall

Regent Park Community Centre

TICKETS

Admission is free, donations are encouraged.

No reservation required.

Jessica Stockholder: The Squared Circle: Ringing

MOCA is thrilled to present a major new commission by the groundbreaking American-Canadian artist Jessica Stockholder, “The Squared Circle: Ringing.”

This spring, visitors on Floor 1 are invited to experience a new large-scale, site-specific artwork by Stockholder, alongside a series of text-based gestures. Revisiting elements from her 2021 installation “Cut a rug a round square,” Stockholder will further explore the interplay between material, colour, and perspective to transform the space into an immersive experience. Incorporating poetic writing into her practice, she will engage with the museum’s various messages, altering and interrupting them to shift viewers’ attention toward the formal beauty and complexity of language.

Often referred to as “paintings in space,” Stockholder’s work resists easy categorization, existing at the intersection of abstract expressionism, colour field painting, minimalism, and theatre.

Justin Ming Yong: Blur

Experience “Blur,” an exciting site-specific project by Toronto-based textile artist Justin Ming Yong, whose handmade quilts will transform the North End Gallery and the museum’s elevators into immersive art spaces.

Yong has developed a textile practice that reinterprets traditional quilt-making—a craft passed down to him by his mother, an avid quilt-maker. This practice, rooted in centuries-old cultural traditions, explores the interplay of colour, pattern, and geometry. His works, crafted from diverse materials and layered prints, balance harmony and tension, resulting in abstract compositions that are both gestural and hard-edged.

Immerse yourself in “Blur” at MOCA and see how Yong’s vibrant quilts reshape familiar spaces.

Koffler Arts Presents Elinor Carucci & Hannah Altman

Koffler Arts is excited to welcome photographers Elinor Carucci and Hannah Altman to our gallery for an exhibition (May 29 - August 17), curated by Toronto-based artist Barbara Astman. The exhibition highlights the unique dynamic that exists between each artist's practice and their different life stages, exploring life from a Jewish feminist perspective, including womanhood, rituals, family, and the human condition.

Carucci’s works at Koffler Arts are a selection from Midlife (2011-2019), a photographic series and corresponding book (The Monacelli Press, 2019) never previously exhibited in its present format.

Altman’s work explores themes of ritual and lineage, memory and storytelling, incorporating aspects of Jewish culture. The works at Koffler Arts are from her most recent series, We Will Return To You, with a corresponding book (Saint Lucy Books, 2025).

As Astman writes, she, Carucci, and Altman “represent collectively three generations of image-makers who explore life from a feminist perspective. It has been an honour and pleasure to ‘dig deeper’ – to quote Carucci from an interview with Altman – into the work and careers of these two very exciting artists who bring a highly personal Jewish approach to their photographic works.”

Kour Pour: Cosmic Diagrams

On display in the Aga Khan Museum, Kour Pour: Cosmic Diagrams showcases three monumental paintings that explore the kaleidoscopic ways in which different cultures have envisioned the cosmos. Inspired by celestial and terrestrial designs from diverse artistic traditions, and blending elements of Persian carpets, mandalas, and zodiacal charts, these works reveal a shared quest to understand a vast, interconnected cosmic order.

Making a Museum - The Photographic Exhibition

What’s in a photograph? A moment in time, caught between light and memory — a story waiting to be told. Photography preserves the feeling of a moment, not just its details. Unlike an artifact, a photograph offers a small window into the past, inviting us to imagine the lives unfolding just beyond the frame.

At the Ukrainian Museum of Canada – Ontario Branch, several boxes of vintage 35mm slides were uncovered during the development of a recent exhibition. This remarkable collection captures the people — volunteers, artists, visitors, and community members — whose care, creativity, and commitment helped shape the Museum across generations.

Each image offers an intimate connection to the past, deserving a space where every face can be seen and every moment remembered — a quiet tribute to the legacy of the Museum and the many hands and hearts that built it over the past 80 years.

On view until August 22, 2025, Making a Museum: The Photographic Exhibition invites visitors to linger in memory — to see not just the faces of the past, but the spirit that continues to shape the present.

Margaux Williamson: Shoes, books, hands, buildings, and cars

Margaux Williamson paints scenes drawing from the intimate views and objects of her home, studio, bars, city streets, and the natural world around her. Her muted colour palette and ethereal brushwork, combined with contrasting perspectives, evoke the sensation of memories and dreams.

MOCA is pleased to present a solo exhibition featuring several new and recent paintings by the artist on Floor 3 of the museum. “Shoes, books, hands, buildings,” and cars highlights the evolution of Williamson’s painting practice, which has grown in both complexity and scale.

Visit MOCA to experience Williamson’s evocative paintings up close.

Rosalie Favell: Belonging 1982 - 2024

Belonging is the first retrospective of renowned Red River Metis artist Rosalie Favell, showcasing a powerful curated selection of her lens-based works from 1982 to 2024. This exhibition celebrates Favell’s groundbreaking photographic practice—from seminal series like Living Evidence and Plain(s) Warrior Artist to her expansive archive Facing the Camera—which invites us to bear witness and explore the complex themes of identity, empowerment, same-sex desire, community and the nuanced search for belonging through a lens that is both deeply personal and subtly subversive.

Rough & Ready: A History of the Cowboy Boot

The story of the cowboy boot is steeped in history and legend and is neither simple nor straightforward. Since their invention in the late nineteenth century, cowboy boots have embodied contradiction. They have symbolized labor and leisure, freedom and domination, tradition and reinvention. Cowboy boots were born out of industrialization yet refined through expert craftsmanship, they have been used to both celebrate individualism and forge cultural cohesion. They were central to the closing of the West, yet endure as emblems of freedom and wide-open spaces. Over time, cowboy boots have signaled power and privilege as well as resistance and reclamation. Whether worn in the saddle, on screen, or in the streets, cowboy boots remain a cultural touchstone, embodying both tradition and transformation in a constantly changing world.

Saints, Sinners, Lovers and Fools: 300 Years of Flemish Masterworks

The Southern Netherlands — better known today as Flanders — was home to revolutionary artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck, Hans Memling, and others. These extraordinary painters found new ways to depict reality, portray humanity, and tell stories that created parallels to their world then - and to our world today.

This large-scale exhibition, featuring over 80 stunning art works and objects — medieval, Renaissance, and baroque paintings, sculptures and more — offers a doorway into the Southern Netherlands of 1400 to 1700, a dynamic environment where new artistic genres and styles were created and flourished. The exhibition's unique presentation introduces the visitor, through these rare, extraordinary artworks, to stories of enterprising townspeople, prosperous cities, and an ever-developing society

Shapes of the Extraordinary

Guadalupe Carrizo and Paloma Ludueña

Coordenadas Residencia in collaboration with The Red Head Gallery

This exhibition is part of the exchange project developed by Coordenadas Residencia and Red Head Gallery. The exchange program between Buenos Aires, Argentina and Toronto, Canada aims to promote the circulation of artworks by artists from both institutions within a professional and international context. This aligns with one of the main goals of Coordenadas: to serve as a bridge between different actors in the contemporary art field.

Shapes of the extraordinary presents a dialogue between the works of Argentine artists Guadalupe Carrizo and Paloma Ludueña. The proposal stems from a premise that architect and artist Francesco Careri borrowed from the Parisian Flâneurs: “Wasting time = gaining space.” It focuses on the artists' work processes and the materiality of the pieces as points of connection. In different ways, the artists suspend productive time and delve into the craft of weaving new possibilities to understand, appropriate, or expand their contexts.

These experimentations explore the relationship between subject and environment through textile production and performative practices. They are poetic readings of the everyday that stir programmed behaviors—calls to attention regarding cultural and political codes that either enable or restrict actions. These are subjective manifestations of a body that engages with space and proposes other ways of relating to it.

Paloma Ludueña (La Rioja, 1998), through the sustained act of large-scale weaving with minimal tools, interacts with unexpected parts of the space. Her textile pieces are like prosthetics extending from her limbs, allowing her to broaden her capacities to embrace the gallery space and, in the same gesture, propose new ways of traversing it.

Guadalupe Carrizo (Tucumán, 1987) offers statements that awaken new perspectives. She plays with the edge of words, the softness of fabrics, and the sharpness of embroidery. In her constant exchange with others and with a vigilant eye, she detects and disarms, through artistic gestures, the hostile signs of capitalism and its resistance—crystallized in the landscape of everyday life.

“It is interesting how the artists expand the real possibilities of space through their artistic practices. They involve their bodies and engage in concrete movements to dissolve functional existence and allow new zones of contact to emerge. Non-places to be explored—alternative ones with their own symbolic values.”

—Excerpt from the curatorial text

Talisman - An Art Installation

A collaboration between Rajni Perera and Yorgo Liapis, blends a retelling of history, a fully charged object and a speculative fiction sculpture. It attempts a rebalancing of energies and a space between binary identities and viewpoints, while at the same time referencing an incident between two cities at the height of Egypt’s empires Luxor (then Thebes) and Amarna.

The 39 Steps

Richard Hannay is an ordinary Canadian, living a ho-hum life in London when he's pulled into a wild adventure by a mysterious secret agent. Falsely accused of murder and on the run, Hannay races across Scotland to solve the mystery of The 39 Steps.

Part Hitchcock masterpiece, part classic spy novel, part Monty Python comedy - The 39 Steps is a hilarious and fast-paced whodunit featuring a cast of four playing over 100 characters.

A smash hit on Broadway and the West End, The 39 Steps is filled with nonstop laughs, fast-paced fun, thrilling action and some old-fashioned romance!

This laugh-out-loud homage to the classic film thriller is presented in a unique outdoor setting at the iconic Greek Theatre in Guild Park & Gardens.

Winner of the 2007 Olivier Award for Best New Comedy

Guild Festival Theatre’s 2025 Season is presented by ARC Insurance & Financial Services Inc.

Directed by Tyler J. Seguin

THE 52: STORIES OF WOMEN WHO TRANSFORMED TORONTO, A GROUNDBREAKING EXHIBITION

Museum of Toronto is pleased to announce the opening of its momentous exhibition, The 52: Stories of Women Who Transformed Toronto on April 9th. This multidisciplinary exhibition and live theatrical experience took three years to develop and is unlike any other historical presentation. For the first time in Toronto, a museum exhibition celebrates the lives of 52 women who have inspired and transformed Toronto. The exhibit is organized into themes of science, arts and culture, politics, sports, and civic life. The exhibition will run until December 19, 2025 and will be accompanied by a live theatrical experience June 4-8th, presented in association with Luminato Festival Toronto.

The 52 Project

The project was inspired by the fact that women currently make up 52% of the population in Toronto. That statistic was then translated into the number of iconic women celebrated in this exhibition and informed the name.

These women were firsts in their fields, their pursuits or the trails they blazed. We learn of the first female-owned Chinese restaurant, the first woman to practice law, the first female mayor, the first woman elected to the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the first female war correspondent, and the female founder of the first Indian dance company, and the author of the first Indigenous work published in Canada.

Highlighted women in the exhibition:

Adrienne Louise Clarkson (1939- ) The 26th governor general of Canada as well as the first racialized person appointed to the vice-regal position.

Emily Stowe (1831-1903) The first female physician to publicly practise in Ontario and founder of the Canadian Women’s Suffrage Association.

Jackie Shane (1940-2019) Pioneering transgender performer who was a prominent figure in Toronto’s R&B scene in the 1960s.

Josephine Mandamin (1942-2019) Anishinaabe elder, water-rights advocate, and Anishinabek Nation Chief Water Commissioner.

Margaret Atwood (1939- ) Novelist, poet, literary critic, essayist, teacher, environmental activist, and inventor.

Penny Oleksiak (2000- ) Olympic swimmer and Canada’s most decorated Olympian, with seven medals overall.

Exhibition at Museum of Toronto

This is no traditional exhibition. To tell these important stories, this project has commissioned 24 exemplary playwrights to write 52 monologues – one for each transformational woman on the list. The award-winning Canadian playwrights include: Aida Jordao, Alex Cameron, Ali Joy Richardson, Anna Chatterton, Cheri Maracle, Coleen MacPherson, Diane Flacks, Erin Shields, Falen Johnson, Jo SiMalaya Alcampo, Jordi Mand, Julia Hune-Brown, Julie Tepperman, Kanika Ambrose, Keira Loughran, Lisa Ryder, Marcia Johnson, Marjorie Chan, Meghan Swaby, Ophira Calof, Sarena Parmar, Sedina Fiati, Shandra Spears and Sharada Eswar. The filmed monologues feature actors from across the country.

The films will be showcased at the exhibition as they tell the stories, both personal and factual, about each of the iconic 52 women. The exhibition highlights the harrowing, exhilarating, heartbreaking and courageous actions and lives of each of the 52 women. And each has a filmed monologue dedicated to them and their stories.

The exhibition will also feature personal objects, photographs, letters, and mementos of the women, as well as material culture from our city, displayed throughout the space, drawn from the City of Toronto Archives, Toronto History Museums Fine Art and Artifact Collection and personal collections.

The Wedding Party: A Dinner Theatre Escape Room

The Wedding Party

The Experience

Upon arrival, guests will be enchanted by Old Mill’s historic English Tudor architecture. Sipping cocktails and exploring the venue before festivities begin, you will have the chance to meet some of the key characters: the bride, the groom, the best man, and the maid of honour. You may even notice some members of the wedding party acting suspiciously…

Enjoy delicious food and drink, served with a side of puzzles and a mystery to solve. Talk to the characters, explore the venue and work with your team to unravel the mystery behind the smiles of The Wedding Party. This experience includes a three-course dinner (vegetarian and vegan options available).

The Wedding Party is suitable for all ages. Players under 12 years old require adult accompaniment. The experience will run for a limited time only, with the potential for extension based on demand.

The Wedding Party blew guests away last year, selling out for 3 consecutive months.

Event Details

Event Run: Starting July 11

Dates: Friday - Sunday at 7PM

Duration: 2.5 hours

Menu: Three-course dinner (vegan/vegetarian options available) + Full Cash Bar

Attire: Dress to impress

Worlds on Paper: Drawings from Kinngait

The recent digitization of the Kinngait Drawings Archive—90,000 works strong and held by the McMichael for more than three decades—has allowed unprecedented curatorial access to the origins of this now world-renowned graphic tradition.

Curated by Emily Laurent Henderson, Associate Curator, Indigenous Arts and Culture at McMichael, this once-in-a-generation exhibition of more than 200 works foregrounds the cultural continuities of life in Kinngait in the face of dramatic societal change over more than five decades. The adaptability and resilience of this unique community has been documented in works that depict intergenerational knowledge transfer, community building, and boundless imagination.

This exhibition reveals overlooked bodies of work by some of the country’s most beloved artists including Kenojuak Ashevak, Pitseolak Ashoona, Kananginak Pootoogook, and Pudlo Pudlat and introduces audiences to hitherto unknown artists whose work was suppressed by the aims of the print program that prioritized the tastes of settler markets in the South.
