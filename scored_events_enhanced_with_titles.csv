Impulse Comedy Tickets,MainStage,"The reason we do anything is because of electrical impulses transmitting across the neurons in our brain. Sometimes, those neurons in our brains lead us to say or do completely random things, on “Impulse”
Well, one of those things was this show. All done on impulse. The Date? Chosen impulsively. The Comics, all chosen impulsively. The name of the show? You bet it, impulse.
You see, when you chose not to think things through, you sometimes end up with something great. Like Paella or the ‘86 Mets.
Much like Paella, all these comics were chosen to be put on this show because they are great. Like the ‘86 Mets, they are all World Series Champions who owe their success to Bill Buckner.
Mookie Wilson once said: ""I comfort myself by saying if I believe in dinosaurs, then somewhere, they must be believing in me”
Well, these comics believe in you, its now time for you to believe in them, and come check out- IMPULSE COMEDY

RULES FOR LATE MIC:
1. Late Mic is a specialty open mic that takes preference of non-stand up performance. This is reflected in time allotted to performers: bits/panel/characters get 5 minutes. Stand-up gets 3 minutes. Timing is done by a kitchen timer. When the timer rings, your set is over.
2. Late Mic is a safe environment for all people. Late Mic is also a progressive mic and has a no-tolerance policy for regressive material. If your set contains xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic or misogynistic themes, do not be surprised if you are either called out or cut short, it's policy.
3. Late Mic is fun. Have fun out there.

1. Late Mic is a specialty open mic that takes preference of non-stand up performance. This is reflected in time allotted to performers: bits/panel/characters get 5 minutes. Stand-up gets 3 minutes. Timing is done by a kitchen timer. When the timer rings, your set is over.
2. Late Mic is a safe environment for all people. Late Mic is also a progressive mic and has a no-tolerance policy for regressive material. If your set contains xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic or misogynistic themes, do not be surprised if you are either called out or cut short, it's policy.
3. Late Mic is fun. Have fun out there.

You see, when you chose not to think things through, you sometimes end up with something great. Like Paella or the ‘86 Mets.
Much like Paella, all these comics were chosen to be put on this show because they are great. Like the ‘86 Mets, they are all World Series Champions who owe their success to Bill Buckner.

Shuler King Tickets,Cabaret,"Comedian Shuler King was born Frank Williams III in Sumter, South Carolina. He knew at an early age that he was destined to be an entertainer especially since he was the kid known for cracking jokes. King grew up in a traditional 2-parent household in the Bible Belt of the South, where Faith, Hard Work and Education were the foundations of what his parents imparted on him and his two siblings.
Comedy is his passion, but he has taken a rather unusual path to get to where he is thus far. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in Media Arts where he joined The Mighty Illustrious Zeta Zeta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated.  In 2013 he graduated from Gupton Jones Mortuary College with a degree in Mortuary Science. When he isn’t on the road performing at comedy clubs and special events across the country, King works as a licensed funeral director and embalmer in Georgia and South Carolina at his family’s funeral business in South Carolina. He wants to keep his family’s business and legacy alive. He’s probably the only Comedian/Funeral Director on the comedy circuit.
King has opened for some of the most notable and talented comedians and comediennes in the industry.  He credits his parents strict yet loving upbringing, his harsh surroundings growing up and the state of the country today with giving him his comedic style, which he describes as RAW.  King says “Comedy isn’t about being happy all the time. Comedy is just as much about pain that people endure.  When you hear 20,000 people in an arena laugh at a joke it’s because they all can relate to experiencing that same pain”. His comedy career began while he was a Freshman in college, after he took the stage for the very first time at the NCO Club on a military base and the rest is history. King is one of the most energetic rising comedians in the business.
Although the comedy business can be very tough and filled with ups and downs, King credits his unwavering Faith in God as the calming force in his life which keeps him pushing forward. His hilarious videos he posts on his social media have quickly become fan favorites. His recent video post about Donald Trump went viral and was even played on a UK television show. The future is definitely bright for King.

A father of 3 young children, Pat’s appeal stems from his quick wit & relatable take on family. In 2017, McGann began touring as the opening act for Sebastian Maniscalco, moving with him from clubs, to theaters, and to arenas, including 4 sold out shows at Madison Square Garden. McGann’s relatively short, but impressive resume, includes performances on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Montreal’s famed Just For Laughs Festival, Gilda’s LaughFest, The Great American Comedy Festival and the Nashville Comedy Fest. McGann still calls Chicago home.

Impulse Comedy Tickets,MainStage,"The reason we do anything is because of electrical impulses transmitting across the neurons in our brain. Sometimes, those neurons in our brains lead us to say or do completely random things, on “Impulse”
Well, one of those things was this show. All done on impulse. The Date? Chosen impulsively. The Comics, all chosen impulsively. The name of the show? You bet it, impulse.
You see, when you chose not to think things through, you sometimes end up with something great. Like Paella or the ‘86 Mets.
Much like Paella, all these comics were chosen to be put on this show because they are great. Like the ‘86 Mets, they are all World Series Champions who owe their success to Bill Buckner.
Mookie Wilson once said: ""I comfort myself by saying if I believe in dinosaurs, then somewhere, they must be believing in me”

RULES FOR LATE MIC:
1. Late Mic is a specialty open mic that takes preference of non-stand up performance. This is reflected in time allotted to performers: bits/panel/characters get 5 minutes. Stand-up gets 3 minutes. Timing is done by a kitchen timer. When the timer rings, your set is over.
2. Late Mic is a safe environment for all people. Late Mic is also a progressive mic and has a no-tolerance policy for regressive material. If your set contains xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic or misogynistic themes, do not be surprised if you are either called out or cut short, it's policy.
3. Late Mic is fun. Have fun out there.

Coming of Rage is all about these moments. Hosted by Samantha Ling, it’s a night of hilarious comedians sharing rants, realizations, and stories—the ones we’re proud of, and the ones we swore we’d take to the grave… but somehow, we’re now laughing about them onstage.

2. Late Mic is a safe environment for all people. Late Mic is also a progressive mic and has a no-tolerance policy for regressive material. If your set contains xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic or misogynistic themes, do not be surprised if you are either called out or cut short, it's policy.
3. Late Mic is fun. Have fun out there.

You see, when you chose not to think things through, you sometimes end up with something great. Like Paella or the ‘86 Mets.
Much like Paella, all these comics were chosen to be put on this show because they are great. Like the ‘86 Mets, they are all World Series Champions who owe their success to Bill Buckner.

Shuler King Tickets,Cabaret,"Comedian Shuler King was born Frank Williams III in Sumter, South Carolina. He knew at an early age that he was destined to be an entertainer especially since he was the kid known for cracking jokes. King grew up in a traditional 2-parent household in the Bible Belt of the South, where Faith, Hard Work and Education were the foundations of what his parents imparted on him and his two siblings.
Comedy is his passion, but he has taken a rather unusual path to get to where he is thus far. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in Media Arts where he joined The Mighty Illustrious Zeta Zeta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated.  In 2013 he graduated from Gupton Jones Mortuary College with a degree in Mortuary Science. When he isn’t on the road performing at comedy clubs and special events across the country, King works as a licensed funeral director and embalmer in Georgia and South Carolina at his family’s funeral business in South Carolina. He wants to keep his family’s business and legacy alive. He’s probably the only Comedian/Funeral Director on the comedy circuit.
King has opened for some of the most notable and talented comedians and comediennes in the industry.  He credits his parents strict yet loving upbringing, his harsh surroundings growing up and the state of the country today with giving him his comedic style, which he describes as RAW.  King says “Comedy isn’t about being happy all the time. Comedy is just as much about pain that people endure.  When you hear 20,000 people in an arena laugh at a joke it’s because they all can relate to experiencing that same pain”. His comedy career began while he was a Freshman in college, after he took the stage for the very first time at the NCO Club on a military base and the rest is history. King is one of the most energetic rising comedians in the business.
Although the comedy business can be very tough and filled with ups and downs, King credits his unwavering Faith in God as the calming force in his life which keeps him pushing forward. His hilarious videos he posts on his social media have quickly become fan favorites. His recent video post about Donald Trump went viral and was even played on a UK television show. The future is definitely bright for King.

Shuler King Tickets,Cabaret,"Comedian Shuler King was born Frank Williams III in Sumter, South Carolina. He knew at an early age that he was destined to be an entertainer especially since he was the kid known for cracking jokes. King grew up in a traditional 2-parent household in the Bible Belt of the South, where Faith, Hard Work and Education were the foundations of what his parents imparted on him and his two siblings.
Comedy is his passion, but he has taken a rather unusual path to get to where he is thus far. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in Media Arts where he joined The Mighty Illustrious Zeta Zeta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated.  In 2013 he graduated from Gupton Jones Mortuary College with a degree in Mortuary Science. When he isn’t on the road performing at comedy clubs and special events across the country, King works as a licensed funeral director and embalmer in Georgia and South Carolina at his family’s funeral business in South Carolina. He wants to keep his family’s business and legacy alive. He’s probably the only Comedian/Funeral Director on the comedy circuit.
King has opened for some of the most notable and talented comedians and comediennes in the industry.  He credits his parents strict yet loving upbringing, his harsh surroundings growing up and the state of the country today with giving him his comedic style, which he describes as RAW.  King says “Comedy isn’t about being happy all the time. Comedy is just as much about pain that people endure.  When you hear 20,000 people in an arena laugh at a joke it’s because they all can relate to experiencing that same pain”. His comedy career began while he was a Freshman in college, after he took the stage for the very first time at the NCO Club on a military base and the rest is history. King is one of the most energetic rising comedians in the business.
Although the comedy business can be very tough and filled with ups and downs, King credits his unwavering Faith in God as the calming force in his life which keeps him pushing forward. His hilarious videos he posts on his social media have quickly become fan favorites. His recent video post about Donald Trump went viral and was even played on a UK television show. The future is definitely bright for King.
